# the-hashi
<p>This is the api for a japanese version of The Fork website</p>
<p>It will be integrated with mongo db and published at some point, but for now here is the database that I will be connect to "The Hashi" application</p>
<p>To use it the first step is launch the api, In the terminal get into "api-the-hashi" folder, and run "npm run dev" command </p>
<p>If everthing was correct, you must see something like this in your terminal : ðŸ”°Iniciando Servidor API
ðŸ“–MongoDB Conectado</p>
<p>With this step, data it's available to use it</p>
<p>Then you have to get into "the-hashi-app" folder and run the next commands: </p>
<p>npm i</p>
<p>npm start</p>
<p>If everything was ok you can see the app running in your localhost</p>
